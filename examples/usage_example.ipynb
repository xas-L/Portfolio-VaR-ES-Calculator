    "# Portfolio Risk Calculator - Usage Example\n",
    " \n",
    " This notebook demonstrates how to use the Portfolio Risk Calculator project to calculate Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) for a sample portfolio using both Parametric and Monte Carlo methods.\n",
    " \n",
    " **Project Overview:**\n",
    " The calculator is built in Python and leverages libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. It applies financial risk management concepts, referencing Thierry Roncalli's \"Handbook of Financial Risk Management.\"\n",
    " \n",
    " **Before running this notebook:**\n",
    " 1. Ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main `README.md` of the project (cloned the repository, set up a virtual environment, and installed dependencies from `requirements.txt`).\n"

    " - **ES (Expected Shortfall) Return:** The expected loss (as a negative percentage) *given that* the loss exceeds the VaR threshold.\n",

    " To calculate VaR and ES for a different portfolio or with different risk parameters:\n",
    " \n",
    " 1.  **Edit `src/main.py`:** The simplest way with the current project structure is to directly modify the `DEFAULT_PORTFOLIO` dictionary within the `src/main.py` file. You can change asset weights, expected returns, volatilities, the correlation matrix, confidence level, time horizon, etc. After saving your changes to `src/main.py`, re-run Cell 3 in this notebook.\n",
    " \n",
    " 2.  **(Advanced) Modify `run_risk_calculations` (Not implemented in current project):**\n",
    "     A more flexible approach for programmatic use would be to modify the `run_risk_calculations` function in `src/main.py` to accept a portfolio configuration dictionary as an argument. This would allow you to define multiple portfolio configurations in this notebook (or load them from elsewhere) and pass them to the function without altering `src/main.py` each time.\n",
